# G Nail Growth Owner's Guide

**Your complete guide to understanding and using your retention system**

---

## What Is G Nail Growth?

G Nail Growth is your salon's all-in-one retention system. It helps you:

1. **Track every customer visit** - Check customers in when they arrive
2. **Get automatic feedback** - System sends SMS asking customers to rate their experience
3. **Catch problems early** - Low ratings create alerts so you can fix issues before they hit Yelp
4. **Drive Google reviews** - Happy customers (9-10/10) get guided to leave 5★ reviews
5. **Win back inactive clients** - Automatic SMS to customers who haven't returned

Think of it as having a marketing assistant who never forgets to follow up with customers.

---

## How It Works: The Complete Flow

### 1. Customer Visits Your Salon

**What happens:**
- Front desk staff logs into the **Check-in Console** (PIN protected)
- They enter customer's phone number
- System finds existing customer or creates new record
- Staff selects service and enters price
- Customer is checked in immediately

**Why it matters:** This single action triggers everything else automatically.

---

### 2. Automatic Feedback Request (30 Minutes Later)

**What happens:**
- 30 minutes after checkout, system sends SMS to customer
- Message example: *"Hi Sarah! This is G Nail Pines. Thanks for visiting today 💅 We'd love a quick 1–10 rating about your visit: [link]"*
- Customer taps link and rates 1-10
- They can also leave a text comment

**Why it matters:** You get honest feedback while experience is fresh. Most customers respond within an hour.

---

### 3. System Response Based on Rating

#### If Rating is 1-6 (Problem Detected)
**What happens:**
- System creates an **Issue** in your Issues Inbox
- If customer left a comment, AI analyzes it and suggests:
  - Issue category (service quality, cleanliness, wait time, etc.)
  - Severity level (low/medium/high)
  - One-sentence summary
- You see customer name, phone, what they said, and when it happened

**What you do:**
- Review the issue in Issues Inbox
- Call or text the customer to apologize and offer remedy
- Mark issue as resolved once handled
- Learn from patterns (if multiple cleanliness complaints, investigate)

**Why it matters:** You find out about problems BEFORE they become public Google/Yelp reviews.

---

#### If Rating is 7-8 (Satisfied)
**What happens:**
- Feedback is recorded, no alerts
- Customer is thanked for their time

**What you do:** Nothing required. These customers are satisfied but not raving fans yet.

---

#### If Rating is 9-10 (Promoter!)
**What happens:**
- Customer gets immediate follow-up text: *"We're thrilled you had a great experience! 🌟 Would you mind sharing a quick review?"*
- Message includes buttons for both Google and Yelp reviews
- One tap takes them directly to review page

**Why it matters:** You capture promoters at peak satisfaction. Most 5★ reviews come from these customers.

---

### 4. Winback Inactive Customers (Automatic)

**What happens:**
- System identifies customers who haven't visited in 60+ days
- Sends friendly winback message: *"Hi Maria, we miss you at G Nail Pines! It's been about 65 days since your last visit. Reply to book your next appointment."*
- Won't spam - waits 30 days between messages to same customer

**Why it matters:** Reactivates 15-25% of inactive customers. Pure profit since they already know you.

---

## Your Daily Workflow

### Morning: Check "Today" View
1. Log in as Owner (password: demo123)
2. Go to **Today** page
3. See three columns:
   - **Today's Visits** - Who's been checked in
   - **Pending Feedback** - Who we're waiting to hear from
   - **Issues** - Any low ratings that need attention

Takes 2 minutes. You instantly know if anything needs your attention.

---

### Throughout Day: Front Desk Check-ins
1. Staff logs in with PIN (1234)
2. For each customer:
   - Enter phone number
   - Select service
   - Enter price charged
   - Click "Check In"
3. System does rest automatically

Takes 20 seconds per customer.

---

### As Issues Come In: Handle Them
1. Get notification (or check Issues Inbox)
2. Read what customer said
3. Call or text them directly from your phone
4. Apologize, offer remedy (discount, redo, etc.)
5. Mark issue as Resolved in system

Takes 5-10 minutes per issue. Prevents negative reviews.

---

## Understanding Your Dashboard

### Overview Card (Top of Dashboard)
- **Total Customers** - How many unique customers in database
- **30-Day Visits** - Visits in last 30 days
- **Average Rating** - All feedback ratings averaged
- **Active Issues** - Issues not yet resolved

### Feedback Trends Chart
- Shows ratings over time (7, 14, 30, or 90 days)
- Helps spot if satisfaction is trending up/down
- Each bar = average rating for that period

### Recent Visits Table
- Last 10 check-ins
- Customer name, service, price, when visited
- Quick reference for "Did we see Sarah this week?"

## Settings You Can Customize

Go to **Settings** page to adjust business rules:

### Feedback Timing
**Feedback Delay (minutes)**: How long after checkout before SMS is sent
- Default: 30 minutes
- Recommendation: 15-60 minutes
- Why: Long enough customer left, soon enough they remember

### Issue Detection
**Low Rating Threshold**: What rating counts as a problem
- Default: 6 or below creates issue
- Recommendation: 6 or 7
- Why: 7+ means satisfied, 6- means unhappy

### Review Requests  
**Promoter Threshold**: Who gets asked for public review
- Default: 9 or 10 gets review request
- Recommendation: 9+
- Why: Only raving fans likely to leave 5★ review

### Winback Campaigns
**Inactive After (days)**: When customer is considered inactive
- Default: 60 days
- Recommendation: 45-90 days depending on typical visit frequency

**Cooldown Between Messages (days)**: Gap between winback attempts
- Default: 30 days
- Recommendation: 30-45 days
- Why: Prevents feeling spammy

### Review Links
- Set your actual Google Business and Yelp URLs
- Customers tap link → lands directly on review page
- Critical for conversion

## Common Questions

### "Do I have to respond to every piece of feedback?"

**No.** Only low ratings (issues) require action. Ratings 7+ are recorded for analytics but don't need response.

---

### "What if customer doesn't have a phone or doesn't want texts?"

Front desk can still check them in - just skip the SMS. You'll have visit record but no automatic feedback.

---

### "Can I turn off feedback requests temporarily?"

Yes, in Settings change Feedback Delay to 0. This pauses feedback SMS but still tracks visits.

---

### "How do I know if system is working?"

Three checks:
1. **Today page** shows recent check-ins
2. **Dashboard** shows feedback coming in
3. **Issues Inbox** shows problems being caught

If check-ins happening but no feedback → check Settings or contact support.

---

### "What if I get a really angry customer?"

1. Call them immediately (don't just text)
2. Listen and apologize sincerely  
3. Offer concrete remedy: refund, free redo, discount on next visit
4. Follow up 24 hours later to confirm they're satisfied
5. Mark issue Resolved only after they confirm

Most angry customers become loyalists if you handle well.

---

### "How much time does this actually save me?"

**Manual approach:**
- Manually remember to text every customer
- Track who responded in spreadsheet
- Manually sort through feedback
- Manually remember who to follow up with
- **Time: 2-3 hours per day**

**G Nail Growth approach:**
- Front desk checks in (20 seconds)
- System does everything else
- You handle issues as they arrive (5-10 min each)
- **Time: 30-45 minutes per day**

**Net savings: 1.5-2 hours daily**

### 3. Review Your Dashboard Weekly
- Every Monday, look at week's feedback trends
- Spot patterns: specific staff getting complaints? Specific service?
- Address patterns in team meeting

### 4. Celebrate Wins
- Share positive feedback with team in morning huddle
- When customer leaves 5★ review, show whole team
- Creates culture of customer obsession

### 5. Trust the Numbers

## Remember

**This system doesn't replace your personal touch** - it amplifies it. You still make the calls, write the apologies, and build relationships. The system just makes sure nothing falls through the cracks.

**Every customer matters.** One bad experience posted online can cost thousands. One great experience can bring referrals for years. G Nail Growth helps you maximize the great experiences and minimize the bad ones.

**Trust the process.** It takes 2-3 weeks to see patterns. Give it a month, then look at your Google reviews, customer retention, and time saved. The results speak for themselves.
