- Rating and comment
- Status (pending/resolved)

### What to Say:
> "Here's a real example. Let's say Sarah gave us a 5 and said 'Wait time was too long, over an hour.'

> - She complained about wait time  
> - Her phone number is right here
> - This happened yesterday at 2pm
>
> What I do next: I call her.
>
> **[Demonstrate with imaginary phone call]**
> 'Hi Sarah, this is [Owner Name] from G Nail Pines. I saw you had to wait over an hour yesterday and I'm really sorry about that. We had a staff member call in sick and got backed up. I'd like to offer you a free service on your next visit to make up for it.'
>
> Most customers are shocked you called. They expected to be ignored. Now you've turned a complaint into loyalty.
>

---

### Show Issue Statistics

**If available, point out:**
- How many total issues
- How many resolved
- Common categories

### What to Say:
> "Over time, you see patterns. If 5 customers complain about wait time in one week - you know you need more staff. If multiple people mention 'strong fumes' - you check ventilation.

---

## Part 6: The Review Driver (5 minutes)

### Navigate back to Dashboard or Issues

### What to Say:
> "Now let's talk about the opposite scenario: happy customers.
>
> When someone rates you 9 or 10 out of 10, the system sends a second text immediately:"

**Read this out loud:**
> "We're thrilled you had a great experience! 🌟 Would you mind sharing a quick review?"

### What to Say Next:
> "The message includes links to both Google and Yelp. One tap takes them directly to the review page.
>
> Why does this matter?
> - Most customers who love you never leave reviews
> - They need to be asked at the RIGHT moment
> - That moment is right after rating you 9 or 10
>
> We capture them at peak satisfaction. One tap, they're on Google leaving 5 stars."

---

### Show Review Settings

**Navigate to:** Settings → Scroll to "Review Links"

### What to Show:
- Google Review URL field
- Yelp Review URL field

### What to Say:
> "You put your actual Google and Yelp URLs here. When customers tap the review link, they land directly on your review page, logged in, ready to write.
>
> Salons using this get 5-10 new reviews per month instead of 1-2. More reviews = higher ranking = more new customers finding you."

---

## Part 7: Today View - Your Daily Check (4 minutes)

### Navigate to Today Page
**Click:** "Today" in navigation

### What to Show:
Three columns:
1. **Today's Visits**

>
> **Column 1: Today's Visits**
> - Who's been checked in so far today
> - What services they got
> - What time they visited
>
> **Column 2: Pending Feedback**

---

## Part 8: Winback System (4 minutes)

### What to Say:
> "There's one more system running in the background: winbacks.
>
> The system automatically finds customers who haven't visited in 60+ days and sends them a friendly message:"

**Read this out loud:**
> "Hi Maria, we miss you at G Nail Pines! It's been about 65 days since your last visit. Reply to book your next appointment."

### What to Say Next:
> "This runs automatically. The system:
> - Identifies inactive customers every day
> - Sends winback messages
> - Waits 30 days before messaging same customer again
> - Tracks who comes back
>
> Typical results: 15-25% of inactive customers book again. That's pure profit - these are people who already know and trust you, they just forgot or got busy.
>
> You can see winback performance in your analytics."

---

## Part 9: Settings - Your Control Panel (5 minutes)

### Navigate to Settings
**Click:** "Settings" in navigation

### What to Show:
Go through each setting category briefly:

#### 1. Feedback Collection
- **Feedback Delay:** "How long after checkout before text is sent"
- **Low Rating Threshold:** "What ratings create issues"
- **Promoter Threshold:** "Who gets asked for reviews"

### What to Say:
> "You control all the business rules. For example:
> - Want feedback 15 minutes after checkout instead of 30? Change it here.
> - Think a 7 rating should create an issue? Adjust the threshold.
> - Every salon is different, so you customize it."

---

#### 2. Winback Campaigns
- **Inactive Days:** "When is someone 'inactive'?"
- **Cooldown Days:** "How long between messages?"

### What to Say:
> "Maybe your customers visit every 3 weeks, not every month. You'd set inactive to 45 days instead of 60. It adapts to YOUR business."

---

#### 3. Review Links
- **Google Review URL**
- **Yelp Review URL**

### What to Say:
> "These are critical. Without correct links, customers can't leave reviews. Make sure these point to your actual business pages."

---

#### 4. Current Summary (Show bottom section)

### What to Show:
- Summary of current rules in plain English

### What to Say:
> "At the bottom, see a summary of your current settings in plain English. No guessing what the numbers mean."

---

#### 5. Data & Reliability (Scroll to bottom)

### What to Show:
- Data storage info
- Error monitoring
- Rate limiting

### What to Say:
> "Your data is backed up daily by the cloud provider. Error monitoring catches problems automatically. This thing is solid."

---

## Part 10: ROI & Closing (5 minutes)

### Navigate to Dashboard (Overview)

### Review the Numbers Together

**Point to metrics and say:**
> "Let's talk about what this is worth to you.
>
> **Preventing Bad Reviews:**
> - Every negative Google review costs you roughly 10-30 potential customers
> - That's $500-1500 in lost revenue per bad review
> - You're catching problems BEFORE they go online
> - One prevented bad review pays for this system
>
> **Driving Good Reviews:**
> - More reviews = higher Google ranking
> - Higher ranking = more discovery
> - Manual review requests: 1-2 per month
> - With this: 5-10 per month
>
> **Reactivating Customers:**
> - 15-25% of winback messages convert
> - Each returning customer worth $200-500 per year
> - That's 3-5 customers per month coming back
>
> **Time Savings:**
> - Manual tracking: 2-3 hours daily
> - With this system: 30-45 minutes daily
> - You save 10-15 hours per week
>
> That's the equivalent of hiring a part-time marketing person, except this never sleeps, never forgets, and costs a fraction."

---

### Address Common Concerns

**"Do I have to respond to EVERY feedback?"**
> No. Only issues (low ratings) require action. Everything else is recorded for analytics.

**"What if customers don't want texts?"**
> Front desk can skip the phone number. You still get visit record, just no automatic feedback.

**"How much time does this actually take daily?"**
> - Morning: 2-3 minutes checking Today page
> - As issues come in: 5-10 minutes per issue to call customer
> - Weekly: 10 minutes reviewing dashboard trends
> - Total: 30-60 minutes per week, not per day

**"What if technical stuff breaks?"**
> System monitors itself. You get notified if anything fails. Plus there's backup support.

---

### Final Demo: Show the Complete Loop

**Quickly recap the flow:**

1. "Customer visits" → Show check-in page
2. "System sends feedback" → Describe SMS
3. "Customer rates experience" → Show feedback form (if accessible)
4. "System creates issue OR requests review" → Show Issues / review message
5. "You handle it personally" → Explain owner action
6. "Problem solved or review captured" → Show result

**Say this:**
> "That's the complete loop. Check-in → Feedback → Action → Result. All automatic except your personal touch on handling issues and celebrating wins."

---

## Part 11: Next Steps (2 minutes)

### What to Say:

> "Here's what happens next:
>
> **Week 1: Onboarding**
> - Train your front desk on check-ins (takes 15 minutes)
> - Make sure everyone has their PIN
> - Start checking in every customer
>
> **Week 2-3: Data Collection**
> - Feedback starts coming in
> - You'll get your first issues

>
> **Week 4: First Analysis**

### Hand Over the Credentials

**Write these down for the owner:**
- Owner login: `demo123`
- Staff PIN: `1234`
- Production URL: `https://gnailsdeploy.vercel.app`

**Say this:**
> "You can log in anytime and explore. Nothing you click will break anything. The more you use it, the more valuable it becomes.
>
> Questions?"

---

## Backup: Handling Common Questions

### "Can I see the actual SMS messages?"
> "Absolutely. In Settings, scroll down - you'll see SMS preview examples with your current rules. Shows exactly what customers receive."

### "What if customer gives bad rating but no comment?"
> "Still creates an issue. You call them and ask what happened. The rating alone tells you something's wrong."

### "Do you see our customer data?"
> "No. All data stays in your database. Nobody else accesses it. This is your private system."

### "Can we customize the message text?"
> "Not yet in the UI, but it's possible. The current messages are proven to get high response rates. We can discuss custom wording if needed."

### "What if Twilio or one of the services goes down?"
> "System degrades gracefully. Check-ins still work, data is still saved. You'd manually follow up with customers until service restores. We get alerted to outages automatically."

### "How do I train new front desk staff?"
> "5-minute process: Show them the check-in page, walk through one customer. They'll have it in 2-3 tries. The interface is designed to be obvious."

## Remember

**This is not a software demo.** This is a business transformation demo. 

Focus on:
- ✅ Problems being solved
- ✅ Time being saved
- ✅ Money being made/saved
- ❌ NOT: Technical features, database schema, API endpoints

Keep it conversational. Let them ask questions. If they're skeptical, acknowledge it: "I get it - seems too good to be true. That's why we're doing a pilot. Use it for a month, then decide."

**End goal:** Owner says "When can we start?" or "I want to try this."
